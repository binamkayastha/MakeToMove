# MakeToMove [Done]

Arduino code for Hatch (Watertown Makerspace Hatch) project MakeToMove. This project was created in around a month, and was presented at FAB11.

Due to advances in technological and society, many people during our day and age spend most of their day sitting, whether is transportation, or work, or playing at home. Thus we created MakeToMove, a giant geodesic dome created to help people get up and move around.

The geodesic dome has sections integrated into it:
 - Two exercise machines, each connected to 4 LED lights and a bubble machine on each end of the dome. (Code for this in LEDLevels)
 - Several aluminium foiled triangles, which when pressed would make a note sound. (Code for this in Music).
 - One projector and a camera which used image differentiation which allows people to play a soccer game. (A proprietary software was used for this.)

There are two ardunio files, with the extension .ino. One of them was to control which LEDs were to turn on depending on how long a person has been exercise.
